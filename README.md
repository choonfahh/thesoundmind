# The Sound Mind

The Sound Mind is a fuss-free music streaming platform, where you discover tailored meaningful music for every moment without bias for free. Simply describe your moment - of your location, activity and mood, to receive a playlist. Immerse in the ultimate experience of bias-free listening while understanding why the songs were recommended for you.

This was my first brainchild project and represented my first MVP - Ruby on Rails for its backend, React for its frontend and Semantic UI for its UI. Its concept was based on research insights of 1,457 responses collected over 6 months, in which recommendations are powered by a crowdsourced music database of 4,050 contributions from 2,500 users from Quora and Reddit.

Thanks to all who have contributed to this along the way.
