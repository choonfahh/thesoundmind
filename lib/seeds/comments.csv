While I had loved that song since OK Computer, the album it appeared on, was released, but on this particular day it seemed different.As the bus left the station and we passed the nearby train station, wove through the streets of London, and entered the motorway, the lyrics paralleled our journey.Transport, motorways and tramlinesStarting and then stoppingTaking off and landingThe emptiest of feelingsDisappointed people, clinging on to bottlesWhen it comes it's so, so, disappointingIt was a perfect song for a perfect ride.",343,69,206,103,172,52
2416,Jerald Navas ,"First, the song name - The title fits so perfectly with what your are currently doing. Your stress does not prevent you from having fun and thus not ñholdinÍ you backî.Second, the lyrics - My favourite part from the song is ñOh IÍve been shaking / I love it when you go crazy / You take all my inhibitions / Baby thereÍs nothing holdinÍ me backî. I feel that this fits perfectly with what you are currently doing and provides you the energy for your activity.The song, featuring electric guitar, is a high energy pop song (in my opinion) that makes you feel you wanna dance and hyped up instantly.",30,6,18,9,15,5
